# Creating a Web Application for an ETF Analyzer 

This is a Jupyter lab program that will build a financial database and web application to analyze an ETF performance. We will construct the ETF and visualizations of its performance using SQL, Python, and the Voilà libray to open in webpage.

## Technologies

The project is in Jupyter Note with the following libraries:

* [Pandas] 

* [Numpy] 

* [Hvplot] 

* [Sqalchemy] 

* [Voia] ( this will be used from terminal type [voila etf_analyzer.ipynb])

## Installation Guide

Install required libraries for program to function correctly.

## Usage

The program allows analyze the daily returns of the ETF stocks both individually and as a whole. Then deploy the visualizations to a web application. It will analyze a single asset in the ETF, Optimize data access with Advanced SQL queries, analyze the ETF portfolio and deploy the notebook as a web application. Use the Voilà library to deploy your notebook as a web application. See below for example.
